# Unity Page Slider

## Core Components

- [Page Slider](../api/TS.PageSlider.PageSlider.html): This core component manages your entire paginated UI system. It houses your pages, triggers page change events, and provides overall control.
- [Page Scroller](../api/TS.PageSlider.PageScroller.html): This component handles the smooth scrolling of your pages. You can configure scrolling behavior and receive notifications when a page transition begins or ends
- [Page View](../api/TS.PageSlider.PageView.html): This serves as the individual page within your paginated system. Here, you build and customize the layout of each page. It also triggers events when a page is activated or deactivated.

## Optional Components

- [Page Dots Indicator](../api/TS.PageSlider.PageDotsIndicator.yml): This optional component provides a collection of dots to visually represent your pages and aid navigation. Users can interact with these dots to jump to specific pages.
- [Page Dot](../api/TS.PageSlider.PageDot.yml): This represents a single dot within the Page Dots Indicator component. Each dot corresponds to a specific page within your paginated UI.

## Setup

You can create a Page Slider in two ways: either with a predefined set of pages and content, or by loading content dynamically into the slider at runtime. Check the following guides for step-by-step tutorials:

- [Using Predefined Content](./setup-editor.md)
- [Implementing Dynamic Content](./setup-runtime.md)
