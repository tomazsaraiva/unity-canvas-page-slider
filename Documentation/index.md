The Unity Page Slider is a Canvas Component that lets you easily create scrollable interfaces with a fixed number of pages. It's perfect for image galleries, menus, level selection, tutorials, and more.

## Features

- **Highly Customizable**: Add any type of content - images, text, buttons, even nested UI elements - to create unique layouts.
- **Smooth scrolling**: Customize the transition speed for a seamless user experience.
- **Page snapping**: Pages snap into place for clear transitions.
- **Clear Navigation**: Interactive Dots provide a visual indicator of the current page and total number of pages.
- **Static and Dynamic**: Build your pages directly in the editor or dynamically at runtime.
